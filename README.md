# note_app
A simple note-taking app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Allows the user to add, edit, and delete notes: click on the "Add Note" button to add a note, click on a note to edit the text, and delete a note by selecting it and clicking the "Delete" button. Note colours will auto-update from a set list as they're added or removed. Core functionality; minimal overhead.
